# Slash Commands System

The slash command system provides instant access to powerful development tools and AI capabilities through a simple command interface.

## How It Works

PiPilot's slash commands use a simple `/` prefix to trigger powerful development actions. Simply type `/` followed by a command in the chat input to access various tools and capabilities.

## Available Commands

### Code Actions

- `/fix`: Automatically fix code issues and bugs
- `/refactor`: Refactor code for better maintainability
- `/optimize`: Optimize code performance and efficiency
- `/document`: Generate comprehensive code documentation

### Development Tasks

- `/test`: Generate and run comprehensive test suites
- `/build`: Build and deploy your application
- `/deploy`: Deploy to production environments
- `/debug`: Debug and troubleshoot issues

### AI Assistance

- `/explain`: Get detailed explanations of code functionality
- `/review`: Perform AI-powered code review
- `/suggest`: Get intelligent code suggestions and improvements
- `/generate`: Generate code from natural language descriptions

### Project Management

- `/plan`: Create detailed implementation plans for features
- `/todo`: Manage and track development tasks
- `/commit`: Generate meaningful commit messages
- `/branch`: Handle Git branching and merging

## Command Examples

### Code Analysis
```
/explain This function handles user authentication
/review The login component implementation
/suggest Better error handling for this API call
```

### Development Workflow
```
/fix The TypeScript errors in this file
/refactor Extract this component into smaller pieces
/optimize This database query is running slowly
/test Generate unit tests for the UserService
```

### Project Tasks
```
/plan Implement user registration feature
/todo Add dark mode toggle to the UI
/commit Fix authentication bug in login flow
```

## Advanced Features

### Contextual Commands

Commands automatically understand the context of your current work:

- **File Context**: Commands work on the currently open file
- **Selection Context**: Apply commands to selected code
- **Project Context**: Understand your entire project structure

### Chain Commands

Combine multiple commands for complex workflows:

```
/fix && /test && /commit
```

### Custom Commands

Create personalized commands for your specific workflow:

```javascript
// Custom command configuration
{
  "name": "deploy-prod",
  "description": "Deploy to production with safety checks",
  "steps": [
    "/test",
    "/build",
    "/deploy production"
  ]
}
```

## Integration with AI

Slash commands integrate seamlessly with PiPilot's AI capabilities:

- **Natural Language**: Describe what you want to accomplish
- **Intelligent Execution**: AI understands context and intent
- **Feedback Loop**: Commands provide detailed feedback and suggestions

## Best Practices

### Command Usage

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed instructions
2. **Use Context**: Reference specific files or functions when needed
3. **Chain Wisely**: Combine related commands for efficiency
4. **Review Output**: Always review AI-generated code before committing

### Workflow Optimization

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use `/` to quickly access commands
- **Command History**: Access previously used commands
- **Favorites**: Mark frequently used commands as favorites
- **Templates**: Save command combinations as templates

<Warning>
Always review the output of AI commands before applying changes to your codebase, especially for production deployments.
</Warning>

<Tip>
The slash command system is designed to be intuitive and discoverable. Type `/` and explore the available commands to find the tools that best fit your workflow.
