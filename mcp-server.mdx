# PiPilot MCP HTTP Server

An HTTP-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI agents with seamless access to PiPilot database operations.

## Overview

The PiPilot MCP Server enables AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, VS Code, and Windsurf to interact with PiPilot databases using natural language queries through the Model Context Protocol.

## Key Features

### HTTP-Based Architecture

- **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP endpoints for all database operations
- **JSON Communication**: Structured data exchange between AI agents and databases
- **Stateless Design**: Scalable architecture for high-performance applications

### Natural Language Database Queries

Transform complex SQL queries into simple conversational requests.

```javascript
// Instead of writing SQL:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active' AND created_at > '2024-01-01'

// Just ask naturally:
"Show me all active users created this year"
```

### Comprehensive Database Operations

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support for all PiPilot database features.

- **Data Retrieval**: Query and filter data with natural language
- **Data Modification**: Insert, update, and delete records conversationally
- **Schema Exploration**: Understand database structure through AI assistance
- **Relationship Navigation**: Traverse complex data relationships easily

## Supported AI Assistants

The MCP Server integrates seamlessly with popular AI development tools:

### Claude
- **Claude Desktop**: Direct integration with Anthropic's Claude
- **Claude Code**: Enhanced coding capabilities with database access

### Cursor
- **AI Chat Integration**: Natural language database queries in Cursor
- **Code Generation**: Generate database-driven code snippets

### VS Code
- **Extensions Support**: Compatible with VS Code MCP extensions
- **Workspace Integration**: Database operations within your development environment

### Windsurf
- **IDE Integration**: Built-in support for PiPilot databases
- **Workflow Automation**: Streamlined development with AI assistance

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install @pipilot/mcp-server
```

### Configuration

```javascript
const { PiPilotMCPServer } = require('@pipilot/mcp-server');

const server = new PiPilotMCPServer({
  database: 'your-database-url',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  port: 3000
});

server.start();
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Query data naturally
const users = await server.query("Find all users who signed up last month");

// Insert new records
await server.query("Add a new user named John Doe with email john@example.com");

// Update existing data
await server.query("Update John's email to john.doe@example.com");
```

<Warning>
Ensure proper authentication and authorization when deploying the MCP Server in production environments.
